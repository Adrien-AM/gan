## Generative Adversarial Network using TensorFlow Keras

This project aims to create an image generator learning from custom databases.

It is based on the [GAN](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2014/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf) model, and more precisely [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf).
